# Bug-Smasher-Game
 JS bug smasher game

Assignment Requirements:

Features:
The bug hops randomly around the game area at a given interval (set interval). The player tries to catch the bug by clicking on it. If he succeeds, the score is incremented and the hopping interval is decremented  by a number of milliseconds, so it gets harder to catch the bug.
If the game becomes too challenging, the payer can reset the speed to the initial hopping interval by clicking the Reset Speed button.
If the player wants, he can start again by resetting the score by clicking the Reset Score button.

Guidelines:
Your GUI does not need to be laid out exactly as the above screenshot, you can use graphics of your own and a different page layout as long as the core functionality of the game is preserved.
